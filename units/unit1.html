                In Unit 1, I began my self-reflection and academic assessment
                journey while taking PACE111. Introducing myself in the initial
                class discussion allowed me to recount and reflect on my
                educational path—from earning an A.S. in Information Systems to
                pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at UMGC. Sharing my
                experiences with web development, Python, and my recent foray
                into C++ highlighted the evolution of my technical skills. It is
                pretty enlightening and reassuring to reflect on the evolution
                of my skills over time. Initially, C++ posed significant
                challenges, and I grappled with a fixed mindset intertwined with
                imposter syndrome as I felt I was way over my head. However,
                recognizing these mental barriers was a crucial learning
                experience. The DAACS assessment further illuminated my academic
                strengths and areas for growth. While I scored highly in
                motivation and strategies, it became evident that I need to
                enhance my metacognitive skills, particularly in planning,
                monitoring, and evaluating my learning processes.

              <p>
                Understanding the importance of a growth mindset is not just an
                academic exercise but a vital tool for my future professional
                endeavors. I hope to one day develop AI software for medicine
                and human augmentation, which will require persistent learning
                and adaptability from my end. By improving my metacognitive
                abilities, I am sure that I will more effectively plan and
                execute complex projects that I will take on that will enhance
                the quality of life for medical trauma survivors, especially
                cancer survivors like myself. The strategies I've committed
                to—such as better planning study sessions and actively seeking
                feedback—will directly translate to professional settings where
                project planning and continual self-improvement are crucial.
                Embracing a mindset focused on mastery rather than just outcomes
                will allow me to contribute meaningfully to AI in medicine and
                biotechnology.

            <h3 class="accordion-header">Identifying Key Takeaways</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>
                The pivotal takeaway from this unit is the transformative power
                of adopting a growth mindset. Shifting my perspective has
                already begun alleviating feelings of imposter syndrome and has
                reignited my passion for learning challenging subjects like C++.
                I am now more comfortable with C++ than ever before. I am
                currently working on a project to use my skills to create a
                Thanksgiving "Turkey Trot" turkey costume with automated
                features for my daughter's elementary school 2024 "Turkey Trot"
                event. The most consequential benefit of Unit 1, of course, was
                the insights gleaned from the DAACS assessment, which provided
                valuable insights into my learning habits, emphasizing the need
                for improved metacognition (thinking about thinking).
                Recognizing that planning, monitoring, and evaluating are not
                just academic exercises but essential life skills has been
                illuminating my growth as I finish my degree. This unit has
                reinforced my belief that personal and professional development
                will be ever-ongoing, and I will continue developing my
                self-awareness, resilience, and willingness to seek help and
                resources when needed.
