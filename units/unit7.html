        <h3>My Support Services</h3>

        <p>
          After an eight-year hiatus from my academic journey toward a
          Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, taking PACE111 at the
          University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) has made me keenly aware
          of the significance of utilizing the university's support services and
          resources to overcome challenges towards achieving my goals. Having
          already earned an Associate's degree, I thought I understood what I
          needed to do and how to structure my studies and schedule, but
          ultimately, I was wrong. The learning resources available at UMGC have
          proved to be priceless. Three services that have proved highly
          beneficial and will continue to be as I finish my Bachelor's degree
          include Tutoring Services, Career Services, and the UMGC Library.
        </p>

        <h4>Tutoring Services</h4>
        <p>
          First, Tutoring Services is an invaluable resource that provides
          no-cost academic support in various subjects, including mathematics
          and programming. Given the rigorous nature of Computer Science
          courses—such as data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming
          languages���I anticipate encountering complex topics that may require
          additional guidance. I have a habit of being stubborn when seeking
          help, but having first-hand experience with Tutoring Services allowed
          me to get past a conceptual impasse in my programming class before
          seeking help. I see now that accessing tutoring services will enable
          me to reinforce my understanding of complex subjects and enhance my
          problem-solving skills, which is essential for retaining the knowledge
          I attain and staying on track toward graduation.
        </p>

        <p>
          My next programming class will be CMSC 115 (Introductory Programming).
          If I struggle with a programming assignment, knowing that I can
          schedule a tutoring session to receive personalized assistance with
          challenging concepts is like lifting a considerable weight of stress
          off my shoulders. A tutor can offer detailed explanations, work
          through examples, and provide study tips, allowing me to complete
          assignments confidently and deepen my comprehension of the material.
          This proactive approach to learning will improve my academic
          performance and build a solid foundation for programming coursework
          and problem-solving in general.
        </p>

        <h4>Career Services</h4>
        <p>
          Second, Career Services, such as UMGC's Career Quest platform, is a
          crucial feature for UMGC students. One of the many success coaches at
          UMGCC, Ms. Kemi Okiji, made a point to discuss Career Quest during a
          phone conversation, and I am delighted she did, as Career Quest offers
          a comprehensive assortment of elements such as personalized career
          counseling, resume, and cover letter assistance, and access to
          exclusive job listings. I will be sure to take advantage of Career
          Quest moving forward. I would love to explore internship
          opportunities, participate in virtual career fairs, and network with
          industry professionals, enhancing my employability once I finish my
          degree and seek a permanent workplace. This platform is a valuable
          tool for connecting students with potential employers and ensuring
          access to job listings tailored to our fields of study. It further
          emphasizes the proactive steps UMGC encourages its students to take
          toward professional development.
